# Exploratory Data Analysis – Financials Dataset

This project explores product sales and profitability across different countries.  
Using Python and key data-science libraries, the analysis turns raw transaction data into insights that can guide business decisions.


## Business Questions
* Which products generate the highest total sales and profit?  
* Are there products with strong sales but weak profitability, suggesting pricing or cost issues?  
* Which countries contribute the most to overall revenue and profit?  
* Are there mismatches between units sold and revenue (high volume but low revenue)?  
* Which product–country combinations represent the best growth opportunities?



## Key Insights
* High sales do not always mean high profit—cost structures and pricing strategies differ by product.  
* Some countries consistently outperform others in both sales and profit, indicating markets with strong potential.  
* Certain products sell in large volumes but yield lower revenue, suggesting a review of pricing or bundling.



## Tools & Libraries
* *Python* – data manipulation and analysis  
* *NumPy* – numerical computations  
* *Matplotlib & Seaborn* – data visualization
