# Furniture Sales – Exploratory Data Analysis

A data-driven look at retail furniture and office supplies sales (2014–2017) to uncover what drives revenue and profit.

## Project Overview
Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), I explored a Kaggle dataset of furniture transactions to answer:
- How do sales and profit vary by region and customer segment?
- Which product categories and sub-categories are most profitable?
- How do discounts and shipping modes affect profit margins?

## Key Insights
- *Customer Segments:* Corporate customers delivered the highest overall profit.
- *Regional Performance:* Southern region led in profitability, while the Central region recorded the most losses.
- *Product Sub-categories:* Chairs generated the largest profit; Tables consistently lost money despite healthy sales.
- *Shipping Mode:* Second Class shipping produced the best profit margins.
- *Discount Impact:* Tables become unprofitable when discounts exceed 5%.

## Recommendations
- Keep table discounts below *5 %* to protect margins.
- Double down on *Southern region* customers, *Home Office* in the West, and *Corporate* in the Central region.
- Prioritize marketing and inventory for *Chairs* and other high-margin products.
